If you stumbled on this project in relation to Wallabag, don't use this!
Use Wallabag instead. Or perhaps:

  * https://github.com/LordEidi/wombag - Written in Go

Experimental (incomplete) Wallabag API Server that runs under Python 3 and 2.

What a ðŸ‘œ of ðŸ’©.

Remotely similar to https://github.com/clach04/fake-shaarli-server
make something looking like something else, a bridge/gateway/proxy.

Aim to support a subset of the [Wallabag REST API](https://app.wallabag.it/api/doc/) used by:

  * https://github.com/artur-shaik/wallabag-client
      * `python -m pip install wallabag-client`
  * https://github.com/koreader/koreader
      * https://github.com/koreader/koreader/wiki/Wallabag
      * https://github.com/koreader/koreader/tree/master/plugins/wallabag.koplugin
      * https://github.com/clach04/wallabag2.koplugin

So far:

  * Zero authentication support, server accepts any client without any auth check
  * Handles enough for `wallabag list` to work
  * Handles enough for `wallabag export --format epub ID_HERE` to work - either file specified in json "model" or via override OVERRIDE_EPUB_FILENAME os env
  * Handles enough for KoReader Wallabag plugin to list and then download epub entries

* https://github.com/Strubbl/wallabago as a nice short list of API endpoints

1. NOTE - the later 2 cause problems for pypub3 - https://github.com/imgurbot12/pypub (which is why pypub3 is note used).
2. NOTE - pypub as of 2023-07-30 can't handle Wikipedia (style) href links correctly.

## What is this good for?

  * For debugging wallabag clients, e.g. KoReader
  * for replacing the Wallabag epub/page-scraper with an alternative one

## Usage

### Usage Server

    python whatabagacack.py

NOTE expects `entries.json` to exist and be in correct format.
Override file name with operating system environment variable `WEB_SITE_METADATA_FILENAME` to pathname of json file.

DEBUG note, set operating system environment variable `OVERRIDE_EPUB_FILENAME` to full pathname to an epub to always return that one file.


### Usage Dumb Scraper

    python web2epub.py [list of urls]

Example:

    python web2epub.py https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB
    # NOTE requires manually copy/pasting json into entries.json (or some other name)
