If you stumbled on this project in relation to Wallabag, don't use this!
Use Wallabag instead. Or perhaps:

  * https://github.com/LordEidi/wombag - Written in Go

Experimental (incomplete) Wallabag API Server that runs under Python 3 and 2.

What a ðŸ‘œ of ðŸ’©.

Remotely similar to https://github.com/clach04/fake-shaarli-server
make something looking like something else, a bridge/gateway/proxy.

Aim to support a subset of the [Wallabag REST API](https://app.wallabag.it/api/doc/) used by:

  * https://github.com/artur-shaik/wallabag-client
      * `python -m pip install wallabag-client`
  * https://github.com/koreader/koreader
      * https://github.com/koreader/koreader/wiki/Wallabag
      * https://github.com/koreader/koreader/tree/master/plugins/wallabag.koplugin

So far:

  * Zero authentication support, server accepts any client without any auth check
  * Handles enough for `wallabag list` to work
  * Handles enough for `wallabag export --format epub ID_HERE` to work
