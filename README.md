If you stumbled on this project in relation to Wallabag, don't use this!
Use Wallabag instead. Or perhaps:

  * https://github.com/LordEidi/wombag - Written in Go

Experimental (incomplete) Wallabag API Server that runs under Python 3 and 2.

What a ðŸ‘œ of ðŸ’©.

Remotely similar to https://github.com/clach04/fake-shaarli-server
make something looking like something else, a bridge/gateway/proxy.
